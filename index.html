                            Every year the Empire team ramps up, we try to highlight one of the things that makes New York City an amazing place to live, work, visit, and git push origin master in.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This year we return to showcase the little language you know and love at the Academy of Medicine on museum mile, this October 12 and 13.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We're so excited that we're able to feature New York at its finest, and we're really looking forward to pushing Empire, JS, and Node.js towards another incredible year.

                            Empire exists to educate and grow the full stack Javascript community in New York City. We are constantly seeking ways to make our community broader and more inclusive. In support of that, we are excited to once again be granting scholarships for our upcoming conference.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This scholarship will be open to anyone who will be in New York City on October 12 and 13. Because we are a community-run event, we are unable to provide travel and lodging as part of this initiative at this time, but hope to be able to in the future.
                        </p>

We expect speakers, attendees, organizers, and sponsor representatives to be professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund, ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.
